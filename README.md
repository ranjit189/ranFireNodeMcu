Home automation system that gives the user complete control over all remotely controllable devices using an IOT Android app.

Objective
This project aims to develop a home automation system that gives the user complete control over all remotely controllable devices in his/her home using an IOT Android app.

There are many third party online servers and platforms available for showcasing the data of your IOT project. But, out of all of these platforms like ThingSpeak, Adafruit.io, Blynk and IFTT etc., today I select Firebase.

Why Choose Firebase?
Firebase provides a quick way to keep sensory data collected at the device level, and it works great with the Android APIs, which is supported by AndroidThings. A lot of mobile and device programmers that I have come across struggle with server-side programming. Firebase can really help bridge that gap and make it easier. It will be interesting to see developers use its offline features. If you are new to IoT or generally any device that collects data and needs to transmit it over networks, the golden rule to be assumed is that network connectivity cannot be assumed. As a result, you will need to collect the data offline and when the network is available, transmit this over to your server. Firebase with its offline features can really make this simple for a lot of developers.

Firebase has a ton of features including Real-time Database, Authentication, Cloud Messaging, Storage, Hosting, Test Lab and Analytics, but Iâ€™m only going to use Authentication and Real-time Database.
